# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
* The `src` folder contains the TypeScript source code.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Right click on a file in VS Code's explorer and look for the "Append Modification Date to Filename" option.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `src/extension.ts`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

* Open the debug viewlet (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on Mac) and from the launch configuration dropdown pick `Extension Tests`.
* Press `F5` to run the tests in a new window with your extension loaded.
* See the output of the test result in the debug console.
* Make changes to `src/test/suite/extension.test.ts` or create new test files inside the `test/suite` folder.
